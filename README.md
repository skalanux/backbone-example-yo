This project was forked from https://github.com/thomasdavis/backbonetutorials. Actually, I scaffolded it with yeoman and backbone generator and then added the example from backbone tutorials and adapted to take advantage of grunt and bower.

Learn how to use Backbone and Require together to create modular applications that are easy to maintain for solo and team-based projects. As you build your application, you will create many small javascript files with usually no more than 100 lines of code per file. Some developers say that each file does one thing, but we won't hold you to that but we do recommended trying to write smaller files and breaking up the tasks.  

Once you have a working application and you're ready to go to production, you can apply R.js (or alternatively grunt.js) to minify and concatenate this code base into one javascript file that you'll deploy to your website.
